This is a batch file i put together while working on the restore point module for RISE, I originally was building a python version witch would launch from RISE but couldnt get ti to work properly. I decided to go with a batch file since it was easier to import and run.
There are no tools required to run this 
It will prompt the "Run as Administrator" window which you will need to either click yes or no
The restore will take a minute or so to build with either a confirmation or error code
